    <h3> FAQs:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li> <strong>What is HCI?</strong> HCI is about building technology that is useful, usable, learnable and not damaging to people. This involves understanding people, building stuff and evaluating them. 
      It compasses user research, user interface design, user experience design. </li>
    
      <li> <strong>What do HCI folks typically do?</strong> A combination of two things: work with people (surveys, interviews, observations) and work with tech (design, build, use tech). 
        The people and tech could be very diverse. </li>

    <li> <strong>What kinds of jobs?</strong> 
      Often, HCI folks are product managers, startup founders, UI/UX designers, user researchers, and even sometimes electronic product designers. 
      Occasionally, some are academics. There is a huge job market, and fundamentally can't be made redundant by GenAI.
